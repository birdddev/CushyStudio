TODO:

- [ðŸŸ¢] 2024-07-24: fix select many (behave like a single select)
- [ ] 2024-07-24: pressing a letter to open the select do not properly insert the letter in the input
- [ ] 2024-07-24: pressing esc doesn't properly put focus back to the select
- [ ] 2024-07-25: selecting a value reset the popup position => makes it super-hard to select values down the list
- [ ] 2024-07-24: built-in nullability (no more boolean before the value)
- [ ] hovering the select anchor is applying hover effect on the popup, it should not
- [ ] adding enough items to cause the select to wrap is not properly updating the associated reveal position => it should go down a bit
- [ ] single select: picking an item shouldn't close the popup => the MOUSE UP should. otherwise, drag & slide is broken
